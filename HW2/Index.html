	My name is Abdul Ashwood and I am a senior computer science student.</br><br> 

	A little bit about me,<br>

<div class="a">

    <p1> I was born in New Jersey but raised in Hope Mills NC.
	 I did basketball and track while I was in highschool but decided to focus on comp sci upon graduation. I took part in a few clubs during my time at A&T but only stuck with a few. My current clubs are UPE and ACM. Both clubs are comp sci based clubs. I also work as a TA for comp163 in my off time. So there's my quick bio, hope you enjoyed it. <br><br>
