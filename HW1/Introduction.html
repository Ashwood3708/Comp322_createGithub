		<p1>This is my senior year where I have been on<b> 2 internships</b> for my last two summers, first with IBM and second with Target. there I mostly used linux operating systems programming in languages such as <b>java, kotlin, Groovy, etc.</b> I have also taken part in research with <b><i>Dr. Bryant</i></b> where I had to create a website that logs a users browser data and log it into a database which in then an AI would be able to determine the users identity. I have done numerous projects over the last couple of years and I upload them to a public cloud server. Feel free to checkout my <a href="https://github.com/Ashwood3708">Github page</a>.
